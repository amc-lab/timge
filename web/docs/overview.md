# Project Overview

Welcome to the TIMGE documentation. This stub page describes the overarching
goal of the project, the kinds of multi-view experiences we support, and how
the tooling is laid out inside the repo. Replace this file with real content
once you have decided on the documentation outline that best serves your users.

## Key Sections To Consider

- **Context** – what scientific workflows you are targeting and why these views
  exist in the same workspace.
- **Data Requirements** – accepted file formats, folder structure, and how to
  upload new tracks.
- **View Catalogue** – a quick explanation of each view (linear, circos, map)
  and how they interact via dependencies or event propagation.

This dummy file exists purely to wire up the Markdown pipeline. Feel free to
swap it out with your own copy once you are ready to write the actual docs.
